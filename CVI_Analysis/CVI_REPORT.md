# Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) Analysis Report
## Delhi NCR Districts: Central Delhi & Alwar

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) calculations for **Central Delhi** and **Alwar** districts based on the operational formulas for the CVI process. The analysis integrates multiple data sources including temperature, rainfall, population, income, and groundwater data.

---

## Methodology

### Operational Formulas Used

#### 1. Potential Impact (PI)
```
PI = Œ±E + Œ≤S
```
Where:
- E = Exposure index (temperature extremes, rainfall variability)
- S = Sensitivity index (population density, water stress)
- Œ±, Œ≤ = Weights (0.5 each)

#### 2. OUV Vulnerability
```
OUV = PI √ó (1 - AC)
```
Where:
- AC = Adaptive Capacity index (income, urbanization)

#### 3. ESC Potential Impact
```
ESC = Œ¥ √ó OUV + (1 - Œ¥) √ó ESC_Dependency
```
Where:
- Œ¥ = Weighting factor (0.6)
- ESC_Dependency = Community dependence (0.5)

#### 4. Community Vulnerability (CV) - Final CVI
```
CV = ESC √ó (1 - ESC_AC)
```
Where:
- ESC_AC = Economic-Social-Cultural Adaptive Capacity

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Income data missing for Central Delhi** - Affects AC calculation accuracy
2. **Literacy data not available** - Important AC component missing
3. **Limited temporal coverage** - Some datasets from different years
4. **No AQI data integration** - Air quality is an important exposure factor

### Future Enhancements
1. Integrate air quality index (AQI) data into exposure calculations
2. Include literacy and education indicators
3. Add healthcare infrastructure metrics
4. Incorporate land use and green cover data
5. Extend analysis to all Delhi NCR districts
6. Develop time-series CVI tracking (2013-2024)
7. Create interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring

---

## Conclusion

Both Central Delhi and Alwar face **MODERATE** climate vulnerability, but the underlying factors differ significantly:

- **Central Delhi** has high exposure and high sensitivity but benefits from better adaptive capacity through urbanization and infrastructure.

- **Alwar** faces similar exposure levels but much lower sensitivity due to lower population density, partially offset by lower adaptive capacity.

The CVI framework successfully captures these nuances and provides a quantitative basis for prioritizing climate adaptation interventions in both districts.
