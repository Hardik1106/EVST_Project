## 💡 Key Insights

### Central Delhi - "Dense Urban Vulnerability"
**The Problem:**
- Extremely dense population makes it highly sensitive to climate impacts
- Every heat wave affects 27,000+ people per km²
- Shallow groundwater (4.2m) limits water security
- 100% urban = no agricultural buffer

**The Silver Lining:**
- High urbanization provides better infrastructure
- Emergency services more accessible
- Better early warning systems
- Higher adaptive capacity overall

**Risk Profile:** High sensitivity partially offset by good adaptive capacity

### Alwar - "Rural Exposure Challenge"  
**The Problem:**
- Slightly higher exposure to climate extremes
- Low urbanization (17.81%) = limited infrastructure
- Low adaptive capacity to respond to disasters
- Agricultural dependence increases vulnerability

**The Silver Lining:**
- Low population density = lower sensitivity
- Deep groundwater reserves (21.89m)
- Rural communities have traditional coping mechanisms
- Lower resource competition

**Risk Profile:** High exposure partially offset by low sensitivity

## 🎯 Critical Differences

### What Makes Central Delhi Vulnerable?
1. **Population Pressure**: 63× more dense than Alwar
2. **Heat Island Effect**: Urban concrete amplifies temperatures
3. **Water Stress**: Shallow groundwater, high demand
4. **No Escape**: 100% urban with no green buffer

### What Makes Alwar Vulnerable?
1. **Low Adaptive Capacity**: Limited infrastructure and services
2. **Climate Exposure**: Higher rainfall variability
3. **Rural Dependencies**: Agriculture vulnerable to climate change
4. **Service Gap**: Limited healthcare and emergency response

## 📈 Formula Implementation

Successfully implemented all 4 operational formulas:

```
✓ PI = α×E + β×S (Potential Impact)
✓ OUV = PI × (1-AC) (OUV Vulnerability)  
✓ ESC = δ×OUV + (1-δ)×ESC_Dep (ESC Impact)
✓ CV = ESC × (1-ESC_AC) (Community Vulnerability)
```

**Weights Used:**
- α = 0.5 (Exposure weight)
- β = 0.5 (Sensitivity weight)
- δ = 0.6 (OUV weight in ESC)

## 🗂️ Data Integration

Successfully integrated **5 major datasets**:

| Dataset | Records | Period | Used For |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Rainfall | 5,184 | 2013-2024 | Exposure (variability) |
