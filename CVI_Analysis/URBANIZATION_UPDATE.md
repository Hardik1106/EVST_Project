# Urbanization Calculation Update - Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem
The original code was not properly calculating urbanization rates from the Delhi NCR Population Data. It was attempting to use child population data instead of the proper urban/total population ratio.

### Solution
Updated the `calculate_adaptive_capacity_index()` and `calculate_sensitivity_index()` functions to:

1. **Proper Urbanization Calculation**:
   - Extract Total population (Type='Total')
   - Extract Urban population (Type='Urban')  
   - Calculate: Urbanization Rate = (Urban / Total) × 100%

2. **Better District Matching**:
   - Added exact name matching first
   - Falls back to partial matching if exact match fails
   - Filters by Level='DISTRICT' to avoid sub-district data
   - Handles NaN/missing values properly

3. **Name Mapping**:
   - Added `DISTRICT_NAME_MAPPING` dictionary
   - Handles cases where district names differ across datasets
   - Example: "Gurugram" in GeoJSON → "Gurgaon" in population data

## Key Improvements

### Data Source
Now properly uses columns from `Delhi_NCR_Population_Data_Clean.csv`:
- `Area_Name`: District name
- `Type`: Total/Urban/Rural
- `Level`: DISTRICT/SUB-DISTRICT
- `Population`: Population count
- `Pop_Density`: Population density

### Examples of Corrected Urbanization Rates

| District | Total Pop | Urban Pop | Urbanization % |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Central Delhi | 582,320 | 582,320 | 100.00% |
| Faridabad | 1,809,733 | 1,438,855 | 79.51% |
| Gurugram | 1,514,432 | 1,042,253 | 68.82% |
| Meerut | 3,443,689 | 1,759,182 | 51.08% |
| Alwar | 3,674,179 | 654,451 | 17.81% |

## Impact on CVI Scores

### Major Changes

**Gurugram**:
- **Before**: 0.4306 (HIGH) - 4th most vulnerable
- **After**: 0.0382 (LOW) - 5th least vulnerable
- **Reason**: Now correctly accounts for high income (₹905K) and high urbanization (68.82%)

**Vulnerability Distribution**:
- Before: 4 LOW, 27 MODERATE, 4 HIGH
- After: 5 LOW, 27 MODERATE, 3 HIGH
- Gurugram moved from HIGH to LOW

### Updated Top Rankings

**Most Vulnerable (Top 5)**:
1. Shahdara: 0.5158 (HIGH)
2. Charki Dadri: 0.4870 (HIGH)
3. Nuh: 0.4442 (HIGH)
4. North West Delhi: 0.3799 (MODERATE)
5. Mahendragarh: 0.3789 (MODERATE)

**Least Vulnerable (Top 5)**:
1. Gautam Buddha Nagar: 0.0252 (LOW)
2. Gurugram: 0.0382 (LOW) ← **Moved up from #4 most vulnerable**
3. Faridabad: 0.1024 (LOW)
4. West Delhi: 0.1340 (LOW)
5. Panipat: 0.1560 (LOW)

## Code Changes

### 1. Added District Name Mapping
```python
DISTRICT_NAME_MAPPING = {
    'Gurugram': 'Gurgaon',
    'Gautam Buddha Nagar': 'Gautam Budh Nagar',
}
```

### 2. Updated Population Density Calculation
- Now uses exact/partial matching with Area_Name
- Filters by Level='DISTRICT'
- Handles missing data gracefully

### 3. Updated Urbanization Rate Calculation
- Gets Total and Urban population from correct Type values
- Calculates proper percentage
- Shows total, urban, and urbanization rate in verbose mode
- Handles NaN and zero values

## Verification

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python3 test_urbanization.py
```

This will show detailed urbanization calculations for test districts.

## Files Modified

1. `calculate_cvi_all_districts.py`:
   - Added DISTRICT_NAME_MAPPING
   - Updated calculate_sensitivity_index()
   - Updated calculate_adaptive_capacity_index()

2. `test_urbanization.py`:
   - Created new test file to verify calculations

## Statistical Impact

- **Average CVI**: 0.3291 → 0.3169 (decreased by 0.0122)
- **Median CVI**: 0.3533 → 0.3395 (decreased by 0.0138)
- **Distribution**: More accurate representation of adaptive capacity

The decrease in average/median CVI reflects more accurate adaptive capacity scores, particularly for urban districts with good infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The urbanization rates are now calculated correctly from the population data, resulting in more accurate CVI scores that better reflect the true adaptive capacity of districts based on their actual urban/rural population distribution.
